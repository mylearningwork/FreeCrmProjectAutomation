Created Selenium-Java POM framework for automating website https://www.freecrm.com/index.html
Here I have created a robust and easily scalable POM based framework using Selenium & Java for automation purpose.The framework is highly efficient in automating any simple or complex web application.Have used reporting tool like Extent report and robust logging using log4j api. This framework can be used to automate regression test cases and it can save upto 40 % of testing time if used smartly.Best of luck !
