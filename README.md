Created Selenium-Java POM framework for automating website https://www.freecrm.com/index.html
Here I have created a robust and easily scapable POM based framework for automation purpose.The framework is highly efficient in automating any simple of complex
web application.Have used reporting tool like Extent report and robust logging using log4j api. This framework can be used to automate regression test cases
and it can save upto 40 % of testing time if used smartly.Best of luck !
